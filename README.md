# Lensed Quasar Modeling
This repo will store the code I wrote to reconstruct images of gravitationally lensed quasars. In order to reconstruct an image of a lensed quasar there needs to be good estimates on the:
* positions of the quasar images
* position lensing galaxy (if not visible take average distance between the two quasars)
* flux, or amount of light given off by the quasars and lensing galaxy
* a measurement of the root mean square (RMS), and mean background signal of the image_plane_source_list
* exposure time of the images
